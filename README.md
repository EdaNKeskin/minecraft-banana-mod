This banana mod adds a custom banana log, stripped banana log, banana planks, bananas, and golden bananas. Version: 1.19.4-45.1.0 

Issues:
- Banana logs always face up, despite direction it was placed in
- Creative mode tab for this mod doesn't work (commented out in code)
- Wood and bananas are unobtainable outside of creative mode
